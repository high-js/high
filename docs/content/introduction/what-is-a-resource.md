### What is a resource?

In Run's world, a resource is a JSON (or YAML) document that allows to represent almost anything: documents, configs, tools, APIs, libraries,... Embracing the principles of object-oriented programming, a resource is composed of attributes and methods, and can inherit from another resources.

For example, let's create a resource that has a talent for mathematics â€“ it can make additions. First, create a `@resource.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "@implementation": "./index.js",
  "add": {
    "@type": "method",
    "@input": {
      "a": {
        "@type": "number"
      },
      "b": {
        "@type": "number"
      }
    },
    "@output": {
      "@type": "number"
    }
  }
}
```

You can see that there is an `add` method with two inputs and one output. This is the interface of the resource. Now, to perform the actual operation, we need an implementation. So let's create the `index.js` file as follows:

```js
module.exports = () => ({
  add({a, b}) {
    return a + b;
  }
});
```

This is how you implement a resource in JavaScript. For such a simple method, it may seem a little cumbersome to have to write a resource definition so verbose. But as you'll see later, this extra work will allow you to achieve great things.

To begin with, it is possible to invoke the resource directly from the shell:

```shell
run add --a=1 --b=2
```

Nothing happens on the screen, and this is normal, the operation has been executed but for the result to be displayed, you must add the `--@print` CLI option:

```shell
run add --a=1 --b=2 --@print
```

And here's the result:

```shell
3
```

Wonderful but let's try to improve the user's experience a little bit by adding some descriptions and the position of the arguments:

```json
{
  "@implementation": "./index.js",
  "add": {
    "@type": "method",
    "@description": "Compute the addition of two numbers",
    "@input": {
      "a": {
        "@type": "number",
        "@description": "The first number",
        "@position": 0
      },
      "b": {
        "@type": "number",
        "@description": "The second number",
        "@position": 1
      }
    },
    "@output": {
      "@type": "number",
      "@description": "The result of the operation"
    }
  }
}
```

Now, by invoking:

```shell
run @help add
```

A gorgeous help should appear on the screen:

![Math example help screen](${DOCS_BASE_URL}/images/math-example-help.png)

And finally, it is possible to execute the command in a much more appealing way:

```shell
run add 1 2 --@print
```

Too easy? I agree, let's go a little further by composing some resources together.
